**Intentable** is a mixed-initiative caption authoring system that allows the author to steer an **automatic caption generation process to reflect their intents on captions.** In this work, We first derive grammar for specifying the intents, i.e., a caption recipe, and build a neural network that generates caption sentences given a recipe. Our quantitative evaluation revealed that our intent-based generation system not only allows the author to engage in the generation process but also produces more fluent captions than the previous end-to-end approaches without user intervention. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of our system such as context adaptation, unit conversion, and sentence reordering.
